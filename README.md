# Snowplace

A little game I made a couple years ago but never published. I was interrupted before doing things like adding sound effects or polishing up code, but I figured it was a cute little romp worth sharing.

### Credits

Snowplace was possible thanks to these awesome creators:

1. The game was developed using the [Phaser][1] game framework, created by [Richard Davey][2].
2. Each area in the game was layed out using [Tiled][3] map editor, created by [Thorbj√∏rn Lindeijer][4].
3. All of the music and almost all of the images were created by [Pixel-boy][5] for the [Superpowers asset packs][6].
4. The [on-screen controls][7] and [conversational images][8] were created by [Kenney][9].
5. The [thought and speech bubbles][10] were created by [Armando Montero][11].
6. The [key, fire, and bomb][12] were created by [Luis Zuno][13].
7. The [Sniglet font][14] was created by [Haley Fiege][15].
